      <p>
        â€¢ In an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track
        information provided to us by your browser or by our software
        application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you
        came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use,
        the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of
        access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We
        track this information using cookies, or small text files which include
        an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user's browser
        from our servers and are stored on the user's computer hard drive.
        Sending a cookie to a user's browser enables us to collect Non Personal
        information about that user and keep a record of the user's preferences
        when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis.
        The information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared
        with any outside parties. Users who disable their Web browser's ability
        to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site but may not be able to
        successfully use our Service
      </p>
      <p>
        We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID
        cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
        on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove
        persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet
        browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target
        the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. This
        privacy policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only and does not
        cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
